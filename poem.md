#  Bye bye bye 
### Roses are red,
### Violins are blue,
### I have a dog who's cuter than you.

<p>*Water is blue*<p>
<p>Water is grey<p>
<p>Water is more than scooby doo<p>

<p>Scooby doo be doo<p>
<p>Where are you?<p>
<p>You've got to pay attention nooooooow<p>
  
January's new,
February's cold,
March is puffing, blowing too,
April's good as gold;
May's a child of happy face.
Laughter, love, and every grace;
June dreams all the day;
July's for liberty;
August is too hot for play;
September's glorious to see,
October is a ruddy time,
November winds are drear.
December means Old Santa Claus
Will soon be here!
